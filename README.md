# TJ-Tasks-2023--Vivek_singh-
This repository consist of my task of DSA I attended tasks from dsa domain and I attempted Six of them.

EASY

QUESTION 1:-

1) In this time firstly I accepted an array from the user.
2) Then created an empty array of the same size as GIVEN by the user.
3) I started a reverse loop that is from (length-1) Til zero And stored the last index at the first of the empty array and so on.
4) Then I printed the new array with the loop zero to length.

QUESTION 2:-

1) I started this task by accepting an error from the user and the sum.
2) Then I use nested for looks where the first loop i=0 and i<length-1 and second loop runs within the first from j=1+1 and j<length.
3) If a[i]+a[j]==sum.
4) If yes ,then display these pairs(i.e the values of a[i] and a[j]).

QUESTION 3:-

1) I started by accepting the array and the size on the user.
2) Then I used nested for loops,where i=0 and i<=n and within I initialised if=0,j=0 and j<n-1.
3) Then I checked it from  1 to the size every number is present in the array or not using the above nested loop.
4) When a number isn't found in the array display at the statement "MISSING NUMBER".

MEDIUM

QUESTION 2:-

1) First day to input numbers from the user.
2) input users choice whichever operation the user wants to do.
3) Using switch case I checked the multiple operation that are in calculator.
4) Then I performed the respective operation and stored the result in a variable.
5) I printed the result.
6) In case the user does not input the correct choice then display "Wrong choice".

HARD

QUESTION 1:-

1) Create a function Prime(int a) that checks and return true if a number is prime and false if a number is composite.
2) Take the input of range from the user.
3) I started a for loop for start and end limit.
4) I created an object of class and called the function Prime(int a) to check whether the numbber is prime or not.
5) If the function returns true, then I printed the number.

QUESTION 2:-

1) In this task I accepted a number from the user.
2) Then I converted the number to its reversed binary form using a for loop by continuously adding the remainder of the number while dividing it by 2 and adding it using condition r*=10+d.
3) This way we received the reverse binary form of the given number.
4) Now we converted the received binary form into its respective decimal form by starting a loop and adding it using sum+=d*(Math.pow(2,c)) where d contains the extracted digits of the binary form and c consisted of the power.
5) I updated c by 1 each time the loop executes.
6) Then I printed the number.
